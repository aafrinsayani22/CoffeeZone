htdocs - htdocs (or www) is the directory that the Apache web server looks for files to serve on your domain by default.


<img src="\\\\" - should use relative paths for the files.

IDE - intergrated development environment

Apache netbeans version is good


Always use rhash 


		- sha512
		-mdh5

to verify the checksum of your download before you install it:
for checksum while installing any software from the internet.

Client side - HTML, JAVASCRIPT;

Server side - PHP;

Wine is not an emulator.

---------------------------------------------------


always copy your folders in htdocs folders.


Different network protocols:

Common port numbers:

20 - Fiel transfer protocol 
80 - HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol used in world wide web
443 HTTPS secure protocol

A port number is always associated with an IP address of a host and the type of transport protocol used for communication. It completes the destination or origination network address of a message. 


shift-ctr-R (ignor cache, reload all the files from the web server)

browser cache (copy all of the files you "downloaded").

------------------------------------------------------



HTTP response codes

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

200 - OK

GET: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.
HEAD: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.
PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.

404 - Not Found
The server can not find the requested resource. 

 
304 - NOT MODIFIED (the browser use its cache memory.)


While searching on the web:

1) Official documentation (php.net) ----> reliable

2) Fixed websites ( w3 school)

3) blogs (like stack overflow)

PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor"---> is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.

PHP scripts are executed on the server


PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML


A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>

PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).

echo comes handy to print or execute anything;


PHP, keywords, classes, functions, and user-defined functions  and are not case-sensitive.

 NOTE- all variable names are case-sensitive!


 COMMENTING THE CODE IS VERY IMPORTANT

 // This is a single-line comment

# This is also a single-line comment


In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:

echo statement is often used to output any data to the screen


NOTE - we do not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is

PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value.


With PHP, there are two basic ways to get output: echo and print.

<br/> doensnt comes after entering -- the browser doesnt read enter key

The variable 1 has value 14 and variable 2 has value "Montreal"

echo $variable1 + variable2 ; -------> Doesnt work !!!!!
addition doesn't work with one number variable and other string varible ----> use concat(.)


we use backslash when escaping the character.


\n -- new line


Runtime php error -- PHP errors in firefox comes from Apache/PHP engine (8.1)

Netbeans also shows you PHP errors

Absolute path = COMPLETE path
c:\xampp\htdocs\firstwebsite\pictures\x.jpg

RELATIVE path

index.php : c:\xampp\htdocs\firstwebsite

x.jpg: c:\xampp\htdocs\firstwebsite\pictures

. --> current folder
.. --> previous folder

..\pictures\x.jpg


always initialize a variabel to prevent from the warnings

use vardump to get the data type

Debug PHP varible:

1) echo

2) var_dump($abc)

3) print_r($abc)  #prints human Readable info




---------------------------------------------------------------------



The required format parameter of the date() function specifies how to format the date (or time).

Here are some characters that are commonly used for dates:

d - Represents the day of the month (01 to 31)
m - Represents a month (01 to 12)
Y - Represents a year (in four digits)
l (lowercase 'L') - Represents the day of the week


PHP Tip - Automatic Copyright Year

&copy; 2010-<?php echo date("Y");?>

The fgets() function is used to read a single line from a file.


The feof() function checks if the "end-of-file" (EOF) has been reached.

The fgetc() function is used to read a single character from a file.




-------------------------------------------------------------


bit :

0: no electricity
1: electricity


smallest unit in a cpu is the BYTE (8 bit)

SQL server : 4 Bytes for all characters

UTF - 8 

a: 1 Byte
b: 1 Byte
7: 1 Byte
e acute: 2-Bytes


US English characters : 1 byte per character (no accent, no french, a-z, A_Z)

the code i write : can handle UTF-8

international: UTF-8



------------------------------------------


For debugging purposes


use isset - to check if the value is not nulll

use empty funtion to check the input varile is not empty

Function strlen() is used when we require the string length showing a number of bytes whereas function mb_strlen() is used when we require the string length showing number of characters.








---------------
Always use index when using WHERE in database

10000*10000 is many ifs so use indexes and foriegn key 

when its indexed it checks th short data ID 1 > can match it with the indexed list


in index it creates a binary tree.

create a customers tablea nd create a customer ID and make it foriegn key



1)never  ever use root in sql 

2) Protect against sql injection


always specify p for parameters to save debugging time


use stored procedure to prevent from sql injection



linux mint.com 

1)download


latest version

cinnamon


choose canada ---ISO



insert iso in vm




DOnt duplicate anything in the stored procedure

try to insert everything

comments goes in the middle of the stored procedure.


for each table we have to create 5 stored procedures


1) select 
2) search 
3) insert
4) update (ID)
5) delete

final same thing




for mac values (UUID(), p_firstname)


update based upon customer id



wehre 


1) security
2) speed (already compiled)
3) Maintenance


if you choose insert into .............. --> remove points


create stored procedure for delete

use strored procedure to prevent from sql injection


up next 

go into employees and add city check your 


downld xampp in windows
dwnld hiedi sql
dwnld netbeans





backup the database


root can destroy your whole website

create new user 

create two faces manage user authentication

add new user php
specify the password

add objects

select permissions only on my view nd my stored procedure

hold control key> select jsut stored procedure and views


done click ok
 select green > execute

 give permission only on procedure and view




create new php user password and save and open



shwo grants for php@localhosty


right click export and check create and 
to connect to the database

A) PDO (PHP data objects) - Recommended method
 	- you can connect to 12 different databases(MYSQL, 	PostgrESQL, SQL SERVER)
 	-it uses named parameters
 	-all the errors and exceptions are gonna be detected by set_error_handler, set_exception


 B) MYSQLi (MySQL Improved, not MySQL)
 i is bug free

 - will use object oriented  code

 ?,?,?,?
C) MySQLi

	- Object oriented code (procedural)

IN netbeans 

seelct the page and then run to run the page



---------------------------------

1) SQL statements (when you see 'query' wehn running SQL code : 	SQL injection)

2) SQL prepared statement

	good to protect from SQL injection
	bad from a maintenance point of view


#i  integer # d decimals 
# s strubg # blob string




why do we need get result and fetch array

 becuase we have to work with sql database

 E


PDO  you do fetch  --> dont delete it will crash
mysql get result


selected rows


with pdo 

row count


we dont index binary fields because we dont use it for the search operations

MVC

model view controller 

model - business rules, data manupulation , database

view - output 

controllet - input





Access modifiers

public - visible outside

private - visible within class

protected - Accesibel to the childs



for objects property 

in c# 

string var = employee.id


in PHP

$var = $employee->getId();






instead of hard coded sql query use stroed procedure



use html special chars when its coming form dollar post

when select use always order by 

dont forget to use th connection

dont want to see database code in the project

in the employee singular you are gonna 

put login in employee class




save uupdate ,get ,byid


load save delete->singular




singular 


getter and setter a
contruct
load 
save 
insert 
delete

login palce in the customer

plural 

only the construct

AJAX - Asynchronous and XML ( responsse )  HTML(response text) -- jsut send one part
async - non blocking 

0 uninitialized 

1 loading 
2 loaded
3 interactive
4 complete

HTTP Status code 
200: ok
404: page not found
500:internal server errror

laatest javascript file ctrl + f5


the objects - singular  - getters setters load, save, ...

and plural - code

seerver side


xampp - all doors are open 
mysql - only allow localhost connection
	  - root password , dont use root whren you deploy
	  - root db admin

client side to server through internet ->HTTPS secure(portnubmers - 443 - HTTPS, 80 - http , 3306 - mysql)
		- need certificate and private key to encrypt the communication


request and response

services.msc

Apache - web server ---> its a file server

	html works , jpeg works.
	php - it doesnt interpret 
when install apacge -> install php module


Windows users is imp ?
yes bcoz 
system - ultimate users
never use system user
apache wont run 

no admin ever  for apache or mysql
admin is for development

never use admin ac to run any services



super global variables
$_GET  -> to read parameters entered int he address bar(URL) not confidential 
$_POST -> to read parameters entered in forms - confidential
$_REQUSET -> $_GET or $_POST depending on which one was used  never use this 
$_FILES  ->to read the uploaded files(binary)

$_COOKIE  -> client side saved data
$_SESSION ->server side saved data -->safer
$_SERVER ->headers, path, script, file every about the request , detailes ingo about the requested page (HTTPS, HTTP)
$_ENV  -> short for environment varible -> to access environment variables fo your pc   
$GLOBALS ->contains all the other global variables : $_GET, )$_POST

Encoding: to save data

a: - 1 byte
e acute: - 2,34 bytes

utf8_general_ci -> Case insensitive (a, a , a) consider it as same

ascii codes
 
ASCII IS A 7 byte ecoding (128 max possibilities) a-z 0-9

UTF8
UTF-16: windows 10+
Unicode: Big family of encoding

encoding of most internet connection - ISO-8859-1


Validations 
most imp ->server side
negative amount will be entered 


client side is not safe


what is the mark of the good validation

dont tell the problem.
tell the solution


what is the most imp for making it responsive design
setting the viewport in the meta 

Where do we need to include the files to be availabel for the apache.
in the public folder.(never place .crt or key)


Web servers:    
Apache
Nginx
IIS(microsof)

open source most popular: 

DB:
MYySQL, Postgresql

web server:
apache, ngnix ->faster

* it should run as a service


GIT -> version controlling tool

you control your versions
you commit you save

when should you commit?
after every feature

when you are done, when you are done with the testing


when should you initiallize the git repo
as soon as possible from the day one on your work place


what is imp to test when u wwant to test the lenght of the string
special charactes so use mb_strlen
test your software with special characters


what should you write in the img
alt to get the higher results
change the web site to get the higher in google search results

Mandatory stufss in AJAX
- include the javascript files
- the id to find the element
 form ->reload the whole page
 AJAX-> just one table


what does it mean AJAX
asynchronous-> non-blocking

4 - completes
200 - ok





id ->singular

refreshing one part  of the apage



*IMP*
ajax- >id
form->name



what is heredoc echo <<<END
its just a way to specify the string in multiline

sql injection
$sql = "call loadCustomer(". htmlspecialchars($);

bind param

the only protection is to use the params with pdo or with param with 

if(HTTPS != on)
{
	header('Location: https://index.php'); $client side 
	exit(); # server side ->stoop the execution
}

add to whole project
