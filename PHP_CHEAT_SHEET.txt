htdocs - htdocs (or www) is the directory that the Apache web server looks for files to serve on your domain by default.


<img src="\\\\" - should use relative paths for the files.


-------------------------------------------------

///// : Linux, Apple, Websites

google.ca/images/HD/
google.ca/index.html

IDE - intergrated development environment

Apache netbeans version is good


Always use rhash 


		- sha512
		-mdh5

to verify the checksum of your download before you install it:
for checksum while installing any software from the internet.

Client side - HTML, JAVASCRIPT;

Server side - PHP;

Wine is not an emulator.

---------------------------------------------------


always copy your folders in htdocs folders.


Different network protocols:

Common port numbers:

20 - Fiel transfer protocol 
80 - HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol used in world wide web
443 HTTPS secure protocol

A port number is always associated with an IP address of a host and the type of transport protocol used for communication. It completes the destination or origination network address of a message. 


shift-ctr-R (ignor cache, reload all the files from the web server)

browser cache (copy all of the files you "downloaded").

------------------------------------------------------



HTTP response codes

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

200 - OK

GET: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.
HEAD: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.
PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.

404 - Not Found
The server can not find the requested resource. 

 
304 - NOT MODIFIED (the browser use its cache memory.)


While searching on the web:

1) Official documentation (php.net) ----> reliable

2) Fixed websites ( w3 school)

3) blogs (like stack overflow)

PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor"---> is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.

PHP scripts are executed on the server


PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML


A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>

PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).

echo comes handy to print or execute anything;


PHP, keywords, classes, functions, and user-defined functions  and are not case-sensitive.

 NOTE- all variable names are case-sensitive!


 COMMENTING THE CODE IS VERY IMPORTANT

 // This is a single-line comment

# This is also a single-line comment


In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:

echo statement is often used to output any data to the screen


NOTE - we do not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is

PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value.


With PHP, there are two basic ways to get output: echo and print.

<br/> doensnt comes after entering -- the browser doesnt read enter key

The variable 1 has value 14 and variable 2 has value "Montreal"

echo $variable1 + variable2 ; -------> Doesnt work !!!!!
addition doesn't work with one number variable and other string varible ----> use concat(.)


we use backslash when escaping the character.


\n -- new line


Runtime php error -- PHP errors in firefox comes from Apache/PHP engine (8.1)

Netbeans also shows you PHP errors

Absolute path = COMPLETE path
c:\xampp\htdocs\firstwebsite\pictures\x.jpg

RELATIVE path

index.php : c:\xampp\htdocs\firstwebsite

x.jpg: c:\xampp\htdocs\firstwebsite\pictures

. --> current folder
.. --> previous folder

..\pictures\x.jpg


always initialize a variabel to prevent from the warnings

use vardump to get the data type

Debug PHP varible:

1) echo

2) var_dump($abc)

3) print_r($abc)  #prints human Readable info




---------------------------------------------------------------------



The required format parameter of the date() function specifies how to format the date (or time).

Here are some characters that are commonly used for dates:

d - Represents the day of the month (01 to 31)
m - Represents a month (01 to 12)
Y - Represents a year (in four digits)
l (lowercase 'L') - Represents the day of the week


PHP Tip - Automatic Copyright Year

&copy; 2010-<?php echo date("Y");?>

The fgets() function is used to read a single line from a file.


The feof() function checks if the "end-of-file" (EOF) has been reached.

The fgetc() function is used to read a single character from a file.




-------------------------------------------------------------


bit :

0: no electricity
1: electricity


smallest unit in a cpu is the BYTE (8 bit)

SQL server : 4 Bytes for all characters

UTF - 8 

a: 1 Byte
b: 1 Byte
7: 1 Byte
e acute: 2-Bytes


US English characters : 1 byte per character (no accent, no french, a-z, A_Z)

the code i write : can handle UTF-8

international: UTF-8



------------------------------------------


For debugging purposes


use isset - to check if the value is not nulll

use empty funtion to check the input varile is not empty

Function strlen() is used when we require the string length showing a number of bytes whereas function mb_strlen() is used when we require the string length showing number of characters.
